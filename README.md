# hello-world
My first repository 

Hello. I'm an aspiring web developer learning how to use GitHub. I'm also learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

The hello-world project is all about learning. In it, I'll learn how to:
Create and use a repository
Start and manage a new branch
Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
Open and merge a pull request
